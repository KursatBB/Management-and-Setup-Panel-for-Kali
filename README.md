# Management and Setup Panel for Kali
When you setup new kali VM you need to config somethings like update upgrade or setup the tools. For speed this processes i am developing this tool.<br>
For now i am tried for Kali 2022.4 and Kali 2023.3 version.

# Usage

`sudo python ksetupmain.py `

This tool needs root permissions for installation some of tools. So be careful when using this tool this may occurs security problems. I recommend to delete this tool for security when your job is done.
